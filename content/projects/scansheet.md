### Home Page

The home page serves as the central dashboard for the application, providing quick access to all major features via a grid of interactive cards.

* **View Entries:** Navigates to the [**Entries Page**](#entries-page), where you can view, create, edit, and manage all scan entries.
* **View Categories:** Navigates to the [**Categories Page**](#categories-page) to create and manage the categories that scans can be assigned to.
* **View Dates:** Navigates to the [**Dates Page**](#dates-page), which provides a calendar-based view of all scan records.
* **Today's Report:** A shortcut that navigates directly to the [**Date Page**](#date-page) for the current date, showing all scans recorded today.
* **Open Scanner:** Opens the quick-scan modal. This modal is optimized for rapid scanning (e.g., using a hardware barcode scanner). It listens for a 36-character code and, upon receiving it, automatically submits a new scan record with the current timestamp and the selected category.
* **Add a Scan:** Opens a modal to manually create a new scan record. This form allows you to specify the entry code, select a category, and set a custom date and time, making it ideal for backdating scans or making manual corrections.

### Entries Page

The Entries Page is where you manage all scannable items, from creating new entries and importing them in bulk to exporting or deleting existing ones.

* **Reset Selection** (`history` icon): Clears all currently selected entries.
* **Select All** (`check_box` icon): Selects or deselects all entries visible on the current page. The icon changes to show an indeterminate state (`indeterminate_check_box`) if some, but not all, entries are selected.
* **Download Menu** (`download` icon): Opens a menu with options to export data for the selected entries. This button is disabled if no entries are selected.
    * **Print Badges:** Opens a modal to generate a printable PDF of QR code badges for the selected entries.
    * **Export to PDF:** Opens a modal to create a PDF document listing the selected entries' names and creation dates.
    * **Export to CSV:** Opens a modal to download a CSV file containing the data for the selected entries.
